# List Operations
# ===============
# 
# This exercise provides the opportunity to experiment some more with list creation and the use of their methods. Feel free to skip.
# 
# Create a list 'a' with the elements 10,21,23,11 and 24 in this order


# your code goes here


# Modify the first element and the last element to be 0.


# your code goes here


# The following questions can all be answered using the appropriate methods attached to the list a.
# 
# Add the element 11 at the end of the list a.

# Hint: To explore the available methods, type a.< TAB > in  ipython.


# your code goes here


# How many occurrences of 11 is there in a?


# your code goes here


# Extend the list a with another list ["foo",4]


# your code goes here


# What is the location of the first occurrence of 11?


a.index(11)


# Insert the value 100 as the third element. 

# Hint: All python sequences start at index 0. 


# your code goes here


# Remove the forth element.

# Hint: All python sequences start at index 0. 


# your code goes here


# Remove the first occurrence of 11


# your code goes here


# Sort the list


# your code goes here


# Reverse the list


# your code goes here


# Compute the length of the resulting list. 


# your code goes here


# Test if 11 is in the list anymore and if 99 is *not* in the list


# your code goes here
